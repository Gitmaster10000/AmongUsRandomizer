Hello my name is Mytzi :D.
This is a fan made program to help randomizing players in the Among Us body swap mode.
The program will probably be untrusted by your anti virus, 
but you can open it without admin rights or inside a sandbox environment if you don't trust it.

How to use the randomizer:
Basically you add/remove the amount of players you need, then you set a name for every player and finally you press randomize.
This will randomize all players and copy a text to your clipboard which has to be pasted into a discord chat.
The text will show for every player which player he has to impersonate in spoilers.
In order to ensure name length does not matter the spoilers have a fixed length of 15 characters.
Everyone checks his own spoiler and you can go right into the game.
It is required that your people are not cheating and read other spoilers too.

Example output will look like this:
Player 1 is ||Player 9       ||
Player 2 is ||Player 7       ||
Player 3 is ||Player 5       ||
Player 4 is ||Player 3       ||
Player 5 is ||Player 6       ||
Player 6 is ||Player 2       ||
Player 7 is ||Player 8       ||
Player 8 is ||Player 1       ||
Player 9 is ||Player 10      ||
Player 10 is ||Player 4       ||


Button functionality:
-Reset: This button is not really needed, it simply removes the text of the impersonate player box

-Randomize: This button does the randomize job and copies the output to your clipboard.

-Copy to clipboard: This button just copies the last randomize output to your clipboard.

-Add player: Adds a player below (max is 10).

-Remove palyer: Removes a player below (min is 1).

-Toggle Visible Players: Toggles the impersonate player text box visibility for all players. 
Showing either '???' or the actual name they have to impersonate.
